## Expected prior knowledge 
Geomatics students should have gained 30 ECTS of core geomatics courses (the core courses are: GEO1000, GEO1001, GEO1002, GEO1003, GEO1004, GEO1006, GEO1007, GEO1009, GEO1015, and GEO1016). External students are admitted if they have similar knowledge and skills based on a certified course list.

## Course Content
The project aims at investigating a real-world geo-information problem. Geomatics teachers in cooperation with a company, governmental agency, or a TU Delft research group that is not involved in the Geomatics program the clients define the problem. The problem will be addressed by a group of students. The project enables you to gain further knowledge and skills in acquisition, processing, analysis and interpretation, and visualization of geo-information as well as insights in the running of a project in which diverse stakeholders are involved.

## Study Goals

After this course students are able to:

* understand, through a project at hand, how each of the individual parts of the geo-information process (from measurement (geo-data gathering), geo-data processing and analysis, to presentation, delivery and application) relate to each other and to the chain as a whole.
* apply and expand the knowledge and competences acquired during the core Geomatics courses by developing a solution to a real world geo-information problem.
* apply the basic components of a project management strategy to a project addressing a real world geo-information problem.
* cooperate and communicate with students, tutors and geo-information professionals. In the cooperation, the student shows commitment, perseverance, responsibility, sense of perspective and leadership.
* critically reflect on the quality of the project result(s), on the feasibility to implement the project result(s) in practice, and on their own performance in the project.
* present the work performed in a structured way through an oral presentation to their peers and the wider geo-information community.
