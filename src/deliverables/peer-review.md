# Peer-review

Each team is assigned __another team__ and they have to review their:

1. midterm draft report (written feedback)
1. midterm presentation (asking questions + start a discussion)
1. their final technical presentation (by asking questions and being critical)

You can use the [Rubric for final group report/deliverables](../grading/report.md) as a guide for your review.


For the written feedback, we expect you to:

  1. write a small feedback where you state what is good, what is less good (and how you would concretely improve it)
  2. you can also edit the PDF of the other team and write suggestions, comments, typos, etc. in the margin


## Who reviews who?

| team # | reviews | team # |

| 2    |   ➡️     |  3      |   
| 3    |   ➡️     |  4      |   
| 4    |   ➡️     |  5      |   
| 5    |   ➡️     |  1      |   

When submitting your midterm to SURFdrive, can you also email the other team your PDF so that they have it?

We will also make the PDF available to all in a folder.
