# Peer-review

Each team is assigned another team and they have to review their:

1. midterm draft report (written feedback)
1. midterm presentation (asking questions + start a discussion)
1. their final technical presentation (by asking questions and being critical)

You can use the [Rubric for final group report/deliverables](../grading/work.md) as a guide for your review.
